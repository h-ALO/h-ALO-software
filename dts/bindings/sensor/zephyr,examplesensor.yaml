  An example sensor that reads the GPIO level defined in input-gpios. The
  purpose of this sensor is to demonstrate how to create out-of-tree drivers.

  Example definition in devicetree:

    examplesensor {
        compatible = "zephyr,examplesensor";
        label = "EXAMPLESENSOR";
        input-gpios = <&gpio0 0 (GPIO_PULL_UP | GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW)>;
    };

compatible: "zephyr,examplesensor"

include: [base.yaml, spi-device.yaml]

properties:
    irq-gpios:
      required: true
      type: phandle-array
      description: IRQ pin
        The bIRQ/MDAT pin from the device, which is active low, configurable to
        either driven or high-Z in inactive state.  This has DRDY, POR, CRCCFG,
        and STP interrupts.
